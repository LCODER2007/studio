/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the SEES UNILAG Innovation Suggestion System (SIS) application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure access to user data and suggestions. It enforces strict user-ownership for profiles and admin-only modifications for sensitive suggestion data. Read access is generally open for suggestions, but write access is carefully controlled.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /suggestions/{suggestionId}: Publicly readable suggestions, with restricted write access based on role.
 * - /votes/{voteId}: Stores user votes on suggestions, accessible to the voter and admins.
 * - /comments/{commentId}: Stores comments on suggestions, accessible to all.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Admin role assignments. Document existence grants admin privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled to protect user privacy.
 * - Admin privileges are determined by the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin` collection.
 * - Suggestions are publicly readable to encourage community engagement.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Admin status is checked by verifying the existence of a document in `/roles_admin/{userId}`.
