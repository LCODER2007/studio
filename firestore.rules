/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a combination of ownership-based and public-read/owner-write access patterns.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Access is restricted to the owning user (self-creation allowed). User documents contain a 'role' field used for authorization.
 * - /suggestions/{suggestionId}: Stores suggestions. Readable by all, but only the author can modify. Anonymous submissions are allowed using the 'ANONYMOUS' authorUid.
 * - /votes/{voteId}: Stores votes on suggestions.
 * - /comments/{commentId}: Stores comments on suggestions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly private; only the owning user can read or write their profile.
 * - Suggestions are publicly readable to allow open access.
 * - Relational Integrity: On vote creation, the rule validates that the suggestionId and voterUid are correctly set in the document.
 * - The list operation is allowed on suggestions.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - User roles are denormalized directly onto the /users/{userId} document, avoiding extra reads.
 * - Suggestions have an `authorUid` field for easy ownership checks.
