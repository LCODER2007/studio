/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes strong authorization based on user identity and roles.
 * It uses a combination of ownership checks and role-based access control.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, including roles.  The `uid` field within each user document MUST match the {userId} path segment.
 * - /suggestions/{suggestionId}: Stores suggestions submitted by users. Publicly readable, but writes are restricted to owners or admins.
 * - /votes/{voteId}: Stores votes on suggestions.
 * - /user_votes/{uid}/suggestions/{suggestionId}: Stores user votes on suggestions.
 * - /comments/{commentId}: Stores comments on suggestions.  Write access is limited to authenticated users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read their own profile data.  Admins are not given implicit access to read all user profiles.
 * - Suggestions are publicly readable to support open discussion and discovery.
 * - Data validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping, focusing only on ownership and relational integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - User roles are denormalized into the /users/{userId} document to avoid expensive `get()` calls in the rules.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Publicly readable suggestions are stored in a top-level collection (/suggestions) separate from user-private data.
