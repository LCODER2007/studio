/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes strong authorization based on user identity and roles.
 * It uses a combination of ownership checks and role-based access control to secure data.
 * All write operations are strictly controlled, while read access is more permissive where appropriate.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, including the user's role.
 * - /suggestions/{suggestionId}: Stores suggestions submitted by users.
 * - /votes/{voteId}: Stores user votes for suggestions.
 * - /comments/{commentId}: Stores comments on suggestions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read the votes collection, but cannot modify the collection
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for user profiles (/users/{userId}).
 * - Public read access is granted for suggestions, but write access is restricted to authenticated users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'role' property is denormalized within the /users/{uid} document to enable Authorization Independence.
