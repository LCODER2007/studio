/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Suggestion Box application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure, role-based access control model.
 * Users have full ownership of their profiles, while admins and super admins have elevated privileges for managing suggestions and their statuses.
 * Data access is structurally segregated to ensure that read access for suggestions is open to all, while write access is strictly controlled.
 * Anonymous suggestions are permitted, but all writes are protected by an authorization check.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{uid}: Stores user profile information, with the user's role denormalized directly within the document for authorization.
 * - /suggestions/{suggestionId}: Stores suggestions. The `authorUid` field tracks ownership.
 * - /votes/{voteId}: Stores votes, linking suggestions to users.
 * - /user_votes/{uid}/suggestions/{suggestionId}: Tracks user votes on suggestions.
 * - /comments/{commentId}: Stores comments on suggestions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is denied to protect user privacy.
 * - The `suggestions` collection is publicly readable but only modifiable by authorized users.
 * - Strict role-based authorization is enforced for suggestion management.
 * - Data validation is minimized in this prototyping phase, focusing on critical authorization fields.
